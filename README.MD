# justlog [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gempir/justlog.svg?branch=ansible)](https://travis-ci.org/gempir/justlog)

#### What is this?
justlog is a bot I maintain for a couple of channels. Its features differ from other bots in that it doesn't support
commands, etc. yet, it focuses on logging and providing an api for the logs.
