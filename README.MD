#### What is this?
gempbot is a bot I maintain for a couple of channels. It's features differ from other bots in that it doesn't support
commands etc. yet, it focuses on logging and providing an api for the logs.

#### Usage
You need glide to install the dependencies and you should study the config.json.example if you want to run your own bot
